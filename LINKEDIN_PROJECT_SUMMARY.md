### LinkedIn Post Ideas

#### Post 1: Project Announcement
```
🚀 Just launched ResumeTailor - an AI-powered SaaS platform that reduces resume tailoring time from 2-3 hours to 30 seconds.

Built the entire stack from scratch:
• OpenAI GPT-4o integration with prompt versioning for safe ML iteration
• Enterprise OIDC authentication supporting 5 OAuth providers
• Stripe payment processing with webhook signature verification
• PostgreSQL backend with type-safe Drizzle ORM
• Admin dashboard for operational monitoring

This project showcases production-ready AI/ML infrastructure patterns I use in my contract work (under NDA).

Tech stack: TypeScript, React, Express, PostgreSQL, OpenAI GPT-4o

```

#### Post 2: Technical Deep Dive
```
🧵 How I built safe AI prompt deployment for ResumeTailor:

Problem: Changing AI prompts in production can break functionality

Solution: Versioned prompt system with 3 components:
1. Database-stored prompt versions (PostgreSQL)
2. Admin sandbox for testing new prompts
3. Single "active" version for production traffic

Admins can create, test, and activate prompts without downtime.

This pattern is common in ML infrastructure for model versioning, but I applied it to prompt engineering.

Code walkthrough: [GitHub link]

```

#### Post 3: Lessons Learned
```
💡 3 lessons from building an AI SaaS platform:

1. Never trust client-side payment confirmation
   → Use webhook signature verification (HMAC-SHA256)

2. Prompt engineering deserves version control
   → Built a versioning system for safe iteration

3. Type safety prevents runtime errors
   → TypeScript + Drizzle ORM caught bugs at compile time

Building ResumeTailor taught me more about production AI infrastructure than any tutorial.

## 🎓 Interview Preparation

### When Asked About ResumeTailor

**Opening Statement (30 seconds):**
> "I built ResumeTailor to demonstrate production-ready AI infrastructure patterns I use in my contract work. It's a SaaS platform that uses OpenAI's GPT-4o to tailor resumes for specific industries. The interesting technical challenges were around AI prompt versioning - allowing safe iteration without downtime - and secure payment processing with webhook validation. The entire stack is TypeScript with React, Express, and PostgreSQL, deployed on cloud infrastructure."

**Deep Dive Topics You Can Discuss:**
1. AI prompt versioning architecture
2. Webhook signature verification for payments
3. Enterprise authentication with OIDC
4. Database schema design for SaaS
5. Type-safe API design with TypeScript
6. Scalability considerations (caching, job queues)
7. Observability through structured logging
8. Admin tooling for operational efficiency

**When Asked About Challenges:**
> "The biggest challenge was balancing rapid iteration on AI prompts with production stability. I solved this by building a versioning system where admins can create and test new prompts in a sandbox, then activate them atomically. This pattern is similar to feature flags but specifically designed for ML prompts. It enabled continuous improvement without risking production downtime."

**When Asked About What You'd Improve:**
> "For scaling to 10K+ concurrent users, I'd add:
> 1. Redis caching for frequently accessed prompts and user quotas
> 2. Bull/BullMQ job queue for async resume processing
> 3. Rate limiting per user to prevent abuse
> 4. Read replicas for analytics queries
> 5. APM tooling like Datadog for observability
> 6. Horizontal scaling with load balancer"
